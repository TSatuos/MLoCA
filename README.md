## Machine-Learning-of-Cyber-Attack
### Using Machine Learning to detect whether it is attack or not

## Methods
### Majority rule
#### rule001:using golden ratio weighting 
##### 1)unuse the algorithm that has the heighest FalsePositives rates
##### 2)the algorithm has the heighest Accuracy rates with 1.618
##### 3)the algorithm has the heighest FalsePositives



## Algorithm
### 1.decision tree
### 2.random forest
### 3.naive bayes
### 4.linearSVC
